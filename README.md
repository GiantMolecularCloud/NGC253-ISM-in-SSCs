## Abstract

We present submillimeter spectra of the (proto-)super star cluster (SSC) candidates in the starbursting center of the nearby galaxy NGC 253 identified by Leroy et al. The 2.5 pc resolution of our Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array cycle 3 observations approaches the size of the SSCs and allows for the study of physical and chemical properties of the molecular gas in these sources. In the 14 SSC sources and in the frequency ranges 342.0-345.8 GHz and 353.9-357.7 GHz, we detect 55 lines belonging to 19 different chemical species. The SSCs differ significantly in chemical complexity, with the richest clusters showing 19 species and the least complex showing four species. We detect HCN isotopologues and isomers (H13CN, HC15N, H15NC), abundant HC3N, SO and S18O, SO2, and H2CS. The gas ratios CO/HCN, CO/HCO+ are low, ∼1-10, implying high dense gas fractions in the SSCs. Line ratio analyses suggests chemistry consistent with photon-dominated regions and mechanical heating. None of the SSCs near the galaxy center show line ratios that imply an X-ray-dominated region, suggesting that heating by any (still unknown) active galactic nucleus does not play a major role. The gas temperatures are high in most sources, with an average rotational temperature of ∼130 K in SO2. The widespread existence of vibrationally excited HCN and HC3N transitions implies strong infrared radiation fields, potentially trapped by a greenhouse effect due to high continuum opacities.


## Disclaimer

Note that is this should not be understood as a pipeline to automatically reproduce the results of this publication.
Changes during the analysis and interactive steps may prevent these scripts from running unsupervised.
Instead, they should allow to understand technical aspects of the analysis and retrace it, e.g. to test consistency with future analyses.
Scripts may make intransparent use of convenience functions, such as my [python_helpers](https://github.com/GiantMolecularCloud/python_helpers).
These may be loaded in a python startup file which is not apparent from the scripts.
Also, software versions may not be given. For example, some code may break when run in python3 because it was developed in python2 back then. This applies equivalently for other software packages.
Personal information such as file paths are edited out which may break cross-references between scripts.
Note that many python scripts are actually CASA scripts and require certain packages such as astropy to be installed within CASA.
